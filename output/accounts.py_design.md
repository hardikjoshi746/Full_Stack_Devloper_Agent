## Overview

This module provides a simple account management system for a trading simulation platform. It supports account creation, fund transactions, share transactions, portfolio valuation, and transaction logging.

## Classes and Methods

### Class: Account
This class manages the account details for a user in the trading simulation platform.

#### `__init__(self, username: str) -> None`

- `username`: The name of the account holder.

#### `deposit_funds(self, amount: float) -> None`
Allows users to deposit funds into their account.

- `amount`: The amount of money to be deposited, must be positive.

#### `withdraw_funds(self, amount: float) -> bool`
Allows users to withdraw funds from their account. It checks if withdrawal would result in a negative balance.

- `amount`: The amount of money to be withdrawn, must be positive.
- Returns: `True` if withdrawal is successful, `False` otherwise.

#### `buy_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool`
Records the purchase of shares, ensuring users cannot buy more shares than they can afford.

- `symbol`: The stock symbol for the shares.
- `quantity`: The number of shares to buy, must be positive.
- Returns: `True` if purchase is successful, `False` otherwise.

#### `sell_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool`
Records the sale of shares, ensuring users cannot sell more shares than they possess.

- `symbol`: The stock symbol for the shares.
- `quantity`: The number of shares to sell, must be positive.
- Returns: `True` if sale is successful, `False` otherwise.

#### `calculate_portfolio_value(self) -> float`
Calculates the total value of the user's portfolio based on current share prices.

- Returns: The total portfolio value.

#### `calculate_profit_loss(self) -> float`
Calculates the profit or loss from the initial deposit.

- Returns: The profit or loss amount.

#### `get_holdings(self) -> dict`

## Other Functions

### `get_share_price(symbol: str) -> float`
This standalone function returns the current price of a share for a given symbol. This includes a test implementation with fixed prices for select shares.

- `symbol`: The stock symbol for which to retrieve the price.
- Note: This function is available within the module context.

This design encapsulates all necessary functionalities for the account management system in a single Python module named `accounts.py`. The `Account` class handles the core account operations, calculations, and validation, while interaction with share prices is facilitated through the `get_share_price` function. Each method is designed to ensure data consistency and compliance with business rules.
